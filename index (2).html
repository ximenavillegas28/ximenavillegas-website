        <p class="lead mb-4">I have my own Production Company, Villegas Production, that is seeing great progress since our start in 2020.We are currently working on a romantic comedy with a Shakespearean twist at the end that will get the audience questioning the whole movie. Our production company's goal is to get people talking and create an innovated spin on today's film industry. Before I started my own company I interned for a well know big Production company, I learn so much from that company and I own them a lot. There I picked up on everything, I dedicated all my days in the studios learning everything I could. I listened to all the big shot directors, writers and creators to understand how they work, it was a very fun and informative process. I became on of them as they taught me to camera work, how to create illusions with different angles and how to create the perfect cliffhanger that make the audience both angry but excited for the next showing. 

        <br><br>

        I also do photography on the side, with my great team supporting me we book all types of photoshoots, weddings, gradations, baby showers and many more. More recently we shot a soccer match with amazing once in a lifetime photos on the players. We even got the reaction of the winning shot. With photography I hope to capture unforgettable moments and stop time temporarily for the families we shoot for. we constantly get amazing reviews from our regulars on our website.I have a great support team, we love to come together and give each other tips as we all learn this process together. We enjoy the hustle and work as we have dreamed of being our own creative bosses that get to do what we love everyday, we have our own creative takes on everything we do. Light exposure is something I struggled with in the beginning, I practice everyday. I wrote down the time of day of what light exposure setting I should choose based on the season and time of day. I also did different lightings, such as outdoors, indoors with warm, cool dim and bright lighting. I practice shots at night and saw how exposure was affected at night and how to fix my settings on my camera. I got familiar with every setting of my camera and what it did. I spent countless nights watching and reading about photography and my specific camera. I started photography work in my junior year of high school at 16. I had a helpful teacher that taught us the basic of digital and film camera. My senior year I took AP photography and really understood what it took to take a great photo, how to create depth in a 2D photograph. I learned how a dark room works and how to develop photos. I own a lot to my amazing teacher in high school for what I learned. 
<br><br>

        Our next journey is to do live performance of our own plays and hoping to sell out local theatres. My team is currently working on a horror tragedy we plan on performing in time for this year's Halloween. I have experience in play writing, in all types of genres. I also have experience in acting and singing, I have been in numerous plays and have been around the theatre all my life. Something about transforming into a character and performing my heart out in front of a huge live audience that excites me. I love a challenge, and memorizing lines and performing them on stage gives me the thrill of a lifetime. Collabation is key when it comes to live performance, we all need to be a part of the set designs and decide together how each scene is played out.
